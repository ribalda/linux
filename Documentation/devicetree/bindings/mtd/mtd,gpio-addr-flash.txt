Memory Mapped flash with some address lines addressed using GPIOs

Handle the case where a flash device is mostly addressed using physical
line and supplemented by GPIOs.  This way you can hook up say a 8MiB flash
to a 2MiB memory range and use the GPIOs to select a particular range.

 - compatible :  must be "mtd,gpio-addr-flash", "cfi-flash";
 - reg : Address range of the mtd chip that is memory mapped, this is,
   on the previous example 2MiB.
 - addr-gpios: List of GPIO specifiers that will be used to address the MSBs
   address lines. The order goes from LSB to MSB.

For the rest of the properties, see mtd-physmap.txt.

The device tree may optionally contain sub-nodes describing partitions of the
address space. Check partition.txt for more details.

Example:

	flash@300000 {
		compatible = "mtd,gpio-addr-flash", "cfi-flash";
		bank-width = <2>;
		reg = < 0x00300000 0x00200000 >;
		addr-gpios = <&gpio_0 3 0>, <&gpio_0 4 0>;
	} ;
